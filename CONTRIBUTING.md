# Contributing

A couple of quick tips to ease the submission process.

 * You may use [Github] https://github.com/duanqz/androidlogsuite.git

 * Please reference the bug number from our [issue list](TBD) in any pull requests to help associate fixes with bugs.

 * If possible, add unit-tests for any bugs that you fix.

 * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is our IDE of choice. It has built in debugger support along with Gradle integration.


## Code Styles
 * A rough guideline based on [AOSP Guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).
 * A tab counts as 4 spaces and we use 4 spaces.
